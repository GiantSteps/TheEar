{"name":"eear","tagline":"Real-Time Assistant for Instant Musical Interaction","body":"*eear* is a smartphone app that analyses incoming audio and provides on-screen real-time musical information about the signal, that can be sent via OSC to a laptop or desktop computer for endless musical manipulation and sound-processing.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nFor now, *eear* provides tonal information about the music surrounding the user. It can works in **continuous mode**, providing chord estimations as the music evolves; or in **static mode**, listening for a time period selected by the user, delivering a global estimate of what could be considered the musical key of the music.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, *eear* displays basic timbral information, such as the degree of noisiness, loudness and spectral centroid (a measure of where pitched content is located) of the sound. This information is sent via OSC so it could easily influence musical developments, lighting applications or image processing.\r\n\r\n### Extension\r\n\r\nOn of the great things about *eear* is that it is a work-in-progress built on very flexible technology. For that reason, the addition of new analytical features is extremely easy, and in the near future *eear* will allow the user to choose among context-dependent features. Among them, onset and beat detection are in the top of our list.\r\n\r\n![*eear* graphic interface.](https://github.com/GiantSteps/eear/blob/master/eear-graphic-design/main_screen.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Diagrams\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n\r\n*eear* is built with [Essentia](http://essentia.upf.edu/), the audio procesing library from [Music Technology Group](http://www.mtg.upf.edu/), Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona and [JUCE](http://www.juce.com/), a class library for building rich cross-platform applications and plugins.\r\n\r\n### Team\r\n* Ángel Faraldo (@angelfaraldo)\r\n* Daniel Gómez\r\n* Martin Hermant (@MartinHM)\r\n* Cárthach Ó'Nuanáin (@carthach)\r\n\r\n###Support\r\nIf you have wishes, ideas or comments about future functionality, let us know. Otherwise you might want to come back soon, since we are currently testing and adding new features to the *eear*.\r\n*eear* runs on android devices. However, an IOS version is just around the corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n*eear* was conceived in June 2015 during the Music Hack Day at *Sonar +D* in Barcelona. It won a [#musicbricks](http://musictechfest.net/musicbricks/) Incubation Prize, which has fostered the development of the project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
