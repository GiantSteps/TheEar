{"name":"eear","tagline":"Real-Time Assistant for Instant Musical Interaction","body":"*eear* is a smartphone app that analyses incoming audio and provides on-screen real-time musical information about the signal, that can be sent via OSC to a laptop or desktop computer for endless musical manipulation and sound-processing.\r\n\r\n#### Features\r\nFor now, *eear* provides tonal information about the music surrounding the user. It can act in **continuous mode**, providing chord estimations as the music evolves, or it can work in **static mode**, listening for a time period selected by the user, delivering a global estimate of what could be considered the musical key of the music.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, *eear* displays basic timbral information, including the degree of noisiness, loudness and spectral centroid (a measure of where pitched content is located) of the sound. This information is sent via OSC so it could easily influence musical developments, lighting applications or image processing.\r\n\r\n### Expansion\r\nAll these estimators can be expanded to a great number of them. In the future we will enquiry into their practical utility, to select a few very meaninful ones.\r\n\r\nFuture Improvements that we will consider to work on during the Tech fest: implement onsets detection and beat tracking.  Even further, implement PTP style clocking server for accurate tempo synchronization scenari.\r\n\r\n![*eear* graphic interface.](https://github.com/GiantSteps/eear/blob/master/eear-graphic-design/main_screen.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n###Flow-Diagrams\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n*eear* uses Music Technology Group's audio procesing library *Essentia* and *JUCE* \r\n\r\n### Team\r\n* Ángel Faraldo (@angelfaraldo)\r\n* Daniel Gómez\r\n* Martin Hermant (@MartinHM)\r\n* Cárthach Ó'Nuanáin (@carthach)\r\n\r\n###Contact & Support\r\n\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n*eear* was conceived during a Music Hack Day at *Sonar 2015* in Barcelona, where it won an Incubation Prize by [#musicbricks](http://musictechfest.net/musicbricks/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
