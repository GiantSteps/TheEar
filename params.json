{"name":"eear","tagline":"real-time assistant for instant musical interaction","body":"*eear* is a smartphone app that analyses incoming audio and provides real-time sound and musical information about the signal.\r\n\r\n### Current Features\r\n\r\na) Real-time key estimator (future versions will give the user the power to select among different time windows)\r\n\r\nb) Loudness measure...\r\n\r\nc,d) Spectral flatness and centroid, which provide a measure of how pitched or noisy the input signal is.\r\n\r\nAll these estimators can be expanded to a great number of them. In the future we will enquiry into their practical utility, to select a few very meaninful ones.\r\n\r\nAll the information above, shown on the smartphone screen, is sent via OSC, so any computer with a DAW or digital music software could use this data to influence the generation of music in real-time fitting the enviromental music. (We will demonstrate this in the presentation).\r\n\r\nFuture Improvements that we will consider to work on during the Tech fest: implement onsets detection and beat tracking.  Even further, implement PTP style clocking server for accurate tempo synchronization scenari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Flow-Diagrams\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n\r\n### Team\r\nÁngel Faraldo (@angelfaraldo)\r\nDaniel Gómez\r\nMartin Hermant (@MartinHM)\r\nCárthach Ó'Nuanáin (@carthach)\r\n\r\n###Contact & Support\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n*eear* was originally ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
